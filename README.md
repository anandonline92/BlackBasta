# BlackBasta
Black Basta is ransomware as a service (RaaS) known for high velocity, double extortion operations targeting small to medium size businesses in North America and Western Europe.
Black Basta operators often utilizing unique TTPs to gain entry, spread laterally, exfiltrate data, and drop ransomware. The ransomware is a cross-platform ransomware that is only executed with administrator privileges on both Windows and Linux systems. The ransomware hinders machine processes and ultimately makes desktop files unusable before sending a ransom note to a victim. Their previous attacks suggest that they use stolen credentials (purchased on the Dark Web) to get into organizations â€˜systems. Initial access is often acquired via malicious links in a phishing e-mail. Unlike most cyber threat actors, Black Basta uses numerous tools and remote access methods. Common tools utilized by the group include Qakbot (aka QBot), SystemBC, Mimikatz, ColbaltStrike, and Rclone.
